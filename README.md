<h1>SeenIXO<h1><h2>
  SeenIXO is an airport security AI model that detects suspicious behavior of individuals in an airports. This prompt was given to me and a team of software developers by 
  Sandia National Labratories for Prairie View A&M University's Ignite Hackathon. This was a 24 hour comepetion and my team and I worked tirelessly to create this project.
<h2>
  How it Works:


  We used thre API modelx from ClarifAIL
  
  Facial Recognition: Scanned faces of all indivuals in airport and temporarily saved them to database. It also Scans for individuals facial expressions to detect 
  any odd behavior or aggrassion. If any is detected, it will flag the indivual and send a screenshot of their face to TSA. Once TSA has been informed, they will 
  then keep a close eye on the individual.
 
  
  IBM Fairness360: This is a is an extensible, open source toolkit for measuring, understanding, and reducing AI bias. It combines the top bias metrics, bias mitigation
  algorithms, and metric explainers from fairness researchers across industry and academia. This is to prevent profiling of any kind in the airport.


  Body Recognition: Scanned individuals body language to detect any odd behavior in movement, aggression, and handplacement.
