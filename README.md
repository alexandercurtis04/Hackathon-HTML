<h1>SeenIXO<h1>
<h2>
  SeenIXO is an airport security AI model that detects suspicious behavior of individuals in an airports. This prompt was given to me and a team of software developers by 
  Sandia National Labratories for Prairie View A&M University's Ignite Hackathon. This was a 24 hour comepetion and my team and I worked tirelessly to create this project.
<h2>
  How it Works:

  We used thre API modelx from ClarifAI - 
  
  Facial Recognition: Scanned faces of all indivuals in airport and temporarily saved them to database
 
  
  Facial Expression Recognition: Scanned indiduals facial expressions to detect any odd behavior or aggrassion. If any is detected, it will flag the indivual and send a screenshot 
  of their face to TSA. Once TSA has been informed, they will then keep a close eye on the individual.
